I previously worked as the assistant director for New Renaissance last spring on their production of <i>Friends With Guns</i> and if you told me I would be one of the directors the next spring, I don’t think I would have believed you! It has been a great place to build up my experience and confidence even further.
</p><br>
            <p>I am so grateful to the cast, they are so talented and make the show what it is. They have poured so much time and energy into this play and I cannot imagine this production without them. Vicky, Rachel, Jay, Mer, and Kevin, you all are so talented and I want to thank you for coming to this show and creating so much laughter in and out of the rehearsal space. To our crew, thank you so much for making the world of this show. We truly would not be able to have this vision play out on the stage without your effort. A special thank you to Josephine, I am so excited you got involved with this show you always bring a great energy and bring great stories with you. To the New Ren E-board, thank you for your continued support and answers to all of my silly questions about the show or social media items.</p>
	    <br>
		  <p>And thank you to Siddhie. You genuinely made my semester (and year) when I reached out to see if you would be interested in directing together. You have been such a great co-director, but even more importantly a better friend. I am so glad that I not only got to go through this experience with you, but that I got to become even better friends with you. </p>
	    <br>
		  <p>Lastly, thank you to my family for encouraging me throughout this process. And Finally (this is actually the end I promise!): Thanks to you for showing up and taking the time to see all the hard work these amazing people have put into this play. Enjoy the show!</p>

		  <p>Directing Yoga Play has been an absolute dream. This show is so funny, so entertaining, but most importantly, so full of heart. When I first applied to direct, I went into it hoping to end out my time at Northeastern with a show that would mean something to the people that watched it. But over the past two months, we have been able to put on a production that has surpassed my wildest expectations. I have loved each and every moment that I’ve spent working on it, from those tentative early days, to seeing everyone blossom during tech week.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>None of this would have been possible without the hard work of our cast and crew. I will forever be grateful to the energy, talent, and sheer brilliance they have brought to every rehearsal and run through. I hope as you watch tonight, you note the incredible costumes, set, and lighting that is only as amazing as it is thanks to our creative team. Our stage management, sound, and light crew have been crushing it from beyond the stage and deserve endless praise for how much work they’ve put into this show. There are so many people without whom this show wouldn’t be what it is now, and all of them deserve their flowers.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>This show also wouldn’t have been possible without Brooke. Brooke, who has been there for through every long rehearsal, breakdown, and moment of joy. I was so nervous to direct for the first time, but she’s made the process not only easy, but so, so fun, and I could not be more thankful to her. Brooke, you’re amazing beyond words and it has been the biggest honor to direct alongside you. I also wanted to thank everyone in my life who has been so encouraging, I don’t know where I’d be without you all! Lastly, thank you to everyone who showed up to watch Yoga Play today! I hope that you feel all the joy watching this as I did directing it!</p>
