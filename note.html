I previously worked as the assistant director for New Renaissance last spring on their production of <i>Friends With Guns</i> and if you told me I would be one of the directors the next spring, I donâ€™t think I would have believed you! It has been a great place to build up my experience and confidence even further.
</p><br>
            <p>I am so grateful to the cast, they are so talented and make the show what it is. They have poured so much time and energy into this play and I cannot imagine this production without them. Vicky, Rachel, Jay, Mer, and Kevin, you all are so talented and I want to thank you for coming to this show and creating so much laughter in and out of the rehearsal space. To our crew, thank you so much for making the world of this show. We truly would not be able to have this vision play out on the stage without your effort. A special thank you to Josephine, I am so excited you got involved with this show you always bring a great energy and bring great stories with you. To the New Ren E-board, thank you for your continued support and answers to all of my silly questions about the show or social media items.</p>
	    <br>
		  <p>And thank you to Siddhie. You genuinely made my semester (and year) when I reached out to see if you would be interested in directing together. You have been such a great co-director, but even more importantly a better friend. I am so glad that I not only got to go through this experience with you, but that I got to become even better friends with you. </p>
	    <br>
		  <p>Lastly, thank you to my family for encouraging me throughout this process. And Finally (this is actually the end I promise!): Thanks to you for showing up and taking the time to see all the hard work these amazing people have put into this play. Enjoy the show!</p>
